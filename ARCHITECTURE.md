# Architecture

This project consists of several modules, categorised as follows:
- `core` - basic, project-specific features used across the entire project, except `utils`
- `app` - all the code meets here, also contains the program entry
- `asset`, `ecs`, `graphics`, `window` - independent, essential modules of the project
- `utils` - basic, project-independent utilities

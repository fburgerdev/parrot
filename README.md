# 🦜 Parrot

Welcome to Parrot, a C++ game engine designed as an educational project
to help developers learn about game engine architecture and graphics programming.

## 🚀 About

Parrot is a modern C++ game engine focused on clean architecture
and an intuitive game development. It is asset-based,
meaning everything you do to create a game involves creating and managing assets.
Featuring an entity component system, a rendering pipeline,
an asset manager and window handling, the game engine provides a basic foundation for game development
